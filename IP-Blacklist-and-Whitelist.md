Whitelisting refers to the practice of blocking all entities except those that are explicitly allowed to communicate with tinyfilemanager. Blacklisting means accepting most entities, but excluding those you believe to be malicious or otherwise wish to avoid.

```php
// Possible rules are 'OFF', 'AND' or 'OR'
// OFF => Don't check connection IP, defaults to OFF
// AND => Connection must be on the whitelist, and not on the blacklist
// OR => Connection must be on the whitelist, or not on the blacklist
$ip_ruleset = 'OFF';

// Should users be notified of their block?
$ip_silent = true;

// IP-addresses, both ipv4 and ipv6
$ip_whitelist = array(
    '127.0.0.1',    // local ipv4
    '::1'           // local ipv6
);

// IP-addresses, both ipv4 and ipv6
$ip_blacklist = array(
    '0.0.0.0',      // non-routable meta ipv4
    '::'            // non-routable meta ipv6
);
```
