Basic PHP knowledge is required to customize this Application. You may learn basics [here](http://www.w3schools.com/).

## Requirements

It is a simple, fast and small file manager with single php file. It is also a web code editor. It'll run either online or locally, on Linux, Windows or Mac based platforms. The only requirement is to have PHP 5.5+ available.

* PHP 5.5.0 or higher.
* Zip and Tar extension for zip and unzip actions.
* Fileinfo, iconv and mbstring extensions are strongly recommended.
> Be careful while editing the file manager. If not edited properly, the application may break completely.
No support is provided for faulty customization. check issues or create new one [here](https://github.com/prasathmani/tinyfilemanager/issues)
